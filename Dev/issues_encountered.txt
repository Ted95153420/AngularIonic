ISSUE 1

Services.js

$http.get('http://ergast.com/api/f1/1988/driverStandings.json').then(
				// function(response){
					// return response;
				// },
				// function(error){
					// return "some Error happened"
				// });
				
not working. Returned string representing subset of data and went from there...


Development REALLY slow - switching between text editors / refreshing index page / relying solely on dev tools not a viable option
would be nice to have an IDE where everything is on one place - WebStorm?> NotePad++ easy to overwrite work... USE Source Control

PITFALLS - obsessed with making iphone App - easy to loose track of angular fundamentals.
For example data retrieval using a service. What is the difference between a service and a factory.??\


NOTHING displayed, despite calling the URL and having a databinding dev tools said there was no error. Just to see if your promise returns with no error, I used
return $http.get('https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=isbn:0747532699').then
		(function(response)
		{
			alert(YES);
			//return response.data;
		},
		function(error)
		{
			//return 'something went wrong';
			alerd("NOPE");
		});
		
- the above displayed 'YES', so I knew that the promise was working...
