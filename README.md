# AngularIonic
Android App - uses googles book APi to retrieve book info

Background / folder structure
'Dev' contails html and android controllers. The controllers and services are defined in controllers/app.js
node_modules contains the angular framework that the project uses.


AndroidApp
The Ionic framework was used to create the AndroidApp folder and its contents.
the following command was used :-
'ionic start AndroindApp blank'
this command was run from the AngularIonic folder and basically creates a new IOnic project in the folder 
you specify (in this case the AndroidApp folder).
You can specify different project template types - blank tabs and sidemenu. I went for 'blank' just to keep the app as simple as possible.
I can create tabbed or side menu later. The initial goal was to just create an app that can return book info and deploy it to a mobile device asap.

Overall - think of 'Dev' as a dort of playground - forget about AndroidApp - any new functionality / R&D stuff just get working in here.
At a later date you can incorporate whatever you wrote into your Android app.
