# Book Searcher

Book Searcher is an angular app with well, a fairly unoriginal name. Feel free to think of something better and email me edward.milne@gmail.com. Basically Book Searcher uses googles api to search for a book by ISBN nnumber. Book searcher will :

  - Allow you to input an ISBN number
  - Display the books thumbnail, publisher and a few words about the book



> The reason book searcher was written was because I 'just 
>wanted to'. This is not a commercial application, although do feel free to buy me a pint if you see me out and about. Feel free to contribute to the project. What I'd like to do is scan in an ISBN, or have different tabe to search by author / title etc...

If you want to contribute to this project, then please note that there is a little bit of setup. I talk through this in the most basic way I can in the 'Tech / getting stuff' to work section if you try this and cant get it to work, pleas just ask me. I wont be annoyed / think you are stupid. Infact, I'll be quite flattered that you read the readme as far as you have.
